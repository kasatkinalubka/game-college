# Tic-Tac-Toe in C++

This project implements a simple **Tic-Tac-Toe** game in C++ for two players, X and O, who take turns placing their marks on a 3x3 grid. The game checks for a winner after each move by evaluating rows, columns, and diagonals. If the board is filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw. The results, including wins for each player and draws, are recorded in a file to keep track of the game history.

## Features

- **Board Display**: Shows the current state of the board.
- **Player Moves**: Players input their moves by selecting a row and column.
- **Winner and Draw Checks**: Determines if a player has won or if the game is a draw.
- **Score Tracking**: Reads and writes win-draw statistics from/to a file.
